One conclusion I drew from looking at this analysis is that students attending larger sized schools, overall, had a lower passing rate as compared to students attending small and medium-sized schools. We observe this in the "Scores by School Size" section. Another conclusion is that higher spending ranges is connected to lower passing rates for school, both for the math and reading sections individually as well as overall. Lastly, charter schools had a noticebaly higher passing rate (90%) compared to district schools (54%). Whether or not one can make conclusions on the quality of education among different school types (charter vs district) or among different sized schools, the analysis does tell some interesting patterns/stories.
